It is a personal library made in Python that I created in order to save files with different purposes each.

An example is like "points.py" and "commands.py" (now that I'm writing this, they are the only libraries there are), "points.py" creates it for the purpose of "drawing" in the CMD, while "commands.py" is, in effect, for creating your own console commands.
