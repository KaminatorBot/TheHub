It is a personal library made in Python that I created in order to save files with different purposes each.

An example is like "points.py" and "commands.py" (now that I'm writing this, they are the only libraries there are), "points.py" creates it for the purpose of "drawing" in the CMD, while "commands.py" is, in effect, for creating your own console commands.
Notice that I am not the best of programmers, because the code would not have what we would call "optimization", in my defense, I was just starting out in programming when I made these files and I did not know that "optimization" existed.
